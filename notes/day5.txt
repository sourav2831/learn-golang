1. For reading the file from Hard Drive we need to use ReadFile method from os package
2. ReadFile method returns two value, one is byte slice and second is err if any
3. string(bs) method convert byte slice to string and Split will crate a slice
4. rand method from Math package generate random number.
5. We have to change seed value to have randomized value, for that we have to create a NewSource.
6. In NewSource which takes Int64 value, we can get from time package.
7. By using this new source we can generate randome number with new seeds each time.
