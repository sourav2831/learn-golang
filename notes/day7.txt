1. Structs in go is similar to Objects in javascript
2. Structs in go is pass by value
3. If we want to update structs in functions then we need to use pointers
4. &variable, will give address, and *variable will give value
5. Maps, slice are pass by reference in go
6. maps are iteratable while structs are not.
7. Maps have same type of key and also dont require pointers
